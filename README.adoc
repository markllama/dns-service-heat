== DNS Service for OpenStack with Heat

This repository defines a simple distributed DNS service within an
OpenStack Heat stack.  The goal is to de-mystify DNS services and
deployments for low level delegated sub-domains.  It is NOT to provide
enterprise scale and quality DNS services.

== Deployment Procedure

The stack is deployed using a set of Heat templates and an Ansible
playbook driven by a BASH script. In the future these will be
collapsed so the entire process is driven by Ansible.  For now a small
amount of glue code is still required.
